# odin-recipes

I will be creating HTML files that will contain content for a recipe webpage, 
 per The Odin Project's direction.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my 
understanding of, and skills with, HTML and CSS.

Edit: Upon making my initial commit/push, I saw my format was incorrect in this README file.
after viewing my updated README.md on github.
I have reformatted the file with the correct paragraph breaks.
