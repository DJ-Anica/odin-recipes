# odin-recipes
I used
 
>$ nano README.md


to open the editor in the Linux Terminal.
Then, I proceeded to edit this file in the terminal window.

I will be creating an HTML file listing some recipes, 
as per The Odin Project's direction.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my 
understanding of, and skills with, HTML.

Edit: Upon making my initial commit/push, I learned about the script feature
after viewing my updated README.md on github.
I have reformatted the file with the correct paragraph break.
