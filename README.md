# odin-recipes
I used 
>$ nano README.md
to open the editor in the Linux Terminal.
Then, I proceeded to edit this file in the terminal window.

I will be creating an HTML file listing some recipes, 
as per The Odin Project's direction.

By the end of this project, I will have demonstrated my 
understanding of, and skills with, HTML.
